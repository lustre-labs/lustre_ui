# Lustre UI Pro

Components in `lustre/ui_pro/` are free to use in development and in production
of non-commercial projects, but ideally folks would purchase a license to use
them in commercial projects.

These components are geared towards SaaS applications and include things like
higher level application layouts and more-specific building blocks like a pricing
table or a command bar.
